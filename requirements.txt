langchain==0.2.11            # Keep core langchain for stability
langchain-google-genai==2.1.8
langchain-community==0.2.9
langchain-core==0.2.71       # <--- CRITICAL FIX: Update to satisfy langchain-google-genai (>=0.3.68,<0.4.0).
                             # 0.2.71 is the latest 0.2.x, but if that still conflicts, we might
                             # need to jump to 0.3.x for core and potentially update langchain.
                             # Let's try 0.2.71 first as it's within the 0.2.x range for langchain.
